# i hate u i luv u#
 feeling used
 but i'm still missing you
 and i can't see the end of this
 just wanna feel your kiss
 against my lips
 and now all this time
 is passing py
 but i still can't seem to tell you why
 it hurts me everytime i see u
 relize that how much i luv u
 i hate u i luv u
 i hate that i luv u
 don't want to, but i can't put
 nobody else above u
 i hate u i luv u
 i hate that i want u
 u want her u need her
 and i'll never be her
 i miss u when i can't sleep
 or right after coffee
 or right when i can't eat
 do u miss me like i miss u
 fucked around and got attached to u
 oh oh keep it on the low
 if i were u, i never let me go
 wedding bells were just alarms
 caution tape around my heart
 u ever wonder what we counda been
